Tasks Completed:
	* Created this repository
	* Chose a project idea
	* Wrote one entry in my journal
	
I have decided to make a website to use when I play pathfinder with my friends.  Usually we use
Roll20.net, but it would be nice to have everyone's stats and inventory easily accessable to 
the GM.

I plan on making a sketch of the website layout.  I still have to figure out how to have
the character sheets update in the GM's view while the player is updating it.
