Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.\r\n\r\nAt 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not resume until she can participate in the combat again.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is evil, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nDestruction: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nHealing: The inquisitor is surrounded by a healing light, gaining fast healing 1. This causes the inquisitor to heal 1 point of damage each round as long as the inquisitor is alive and the judgment lasts. The amount of healing increases by 1 point for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nJustice: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice, granting a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled on all attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.\r\n\r\nPiercing: This judgment gives the inquisitor great focus and makes her spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 sacred bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks made to overcome a target?s spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nProtection: The inquisitor is surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the inquisitor.\r\n\r\nPurity: The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her foes, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, the bonus is doubled against curses, diseases, and poisons.\r\n\r\nResiliency: This judgment makes the inquisitor resistant to harm, granting DR 1/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every five levels she possesses. At 10th level, this DR changes from magic to an alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite the inquisitor?s. If she is neutral, the inquisitor does not receive this increase.\r\n\r\nResistance: The inquisitor is shielded by a flickering aura, gaining 2 points of energy resistance against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the judgment is declared. The protection increases by 2 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nSmiting: This judgment bathes the inquisitor?s weapons in a divine light. The inquisitor?s weapons count as magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. At 6th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The type selected must match one of the inquisitor?s alignments. If the inquisitor is neutral, she does not receive this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but not for reducing hardness).","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":12,"featureName":"Monster Lore (Ex)","featureDescription":"The inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on Knowledge skill checks in addition to her Intelligence modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":15,"featureName":"Cunning Initiative (Ex)","featureDescription":"At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on initiative checks, in addition to her Dexterity modifier.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":7,"featureName":"Spells","featureDescription":"n inquisitor casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an inquisitor?s spell is 10 + the spell level + the inquisitor?s Wisdom modifier.\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Inquisitor. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor?s selection of spells is extremely limited. An inquisitor begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the inquisitor?s choice. At each new inquisitor level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an inquisitor knows is not affected by her Wisdom score. The numbers on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known are fixed.)\r\n\r\nUpon reaching 5th level, and at every third inquisitor level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an inquisitor can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the inquisitor ?loses? the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell?s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast.

An inquisitor can select one domain from among those belonging to her deity. She can select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain. With the GM?s approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.\r\n\r\nEach domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell slots. The inquisitor uses her level as her effective cleric level when determining the power and effect of her domain powers. If the inquisitor has cleric levels, one of her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as an inquisitor.

Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.\r\n\r\nAt 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not resume until she can participate in the combat again.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is evil, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nDestruction: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nHealing: The inquisitor is surrounded by a healing light, gaining fast healing 1. This causes the inquisitor to heal 1 point of damage each round as long as the inquisitor is alive and the judgment lasts. The amount of healing increases by 1 point for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nJustice: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice, granting a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled on all attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.\r\n\r\nPiercing: This judgment gives the inquisitor great focus and makes her spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 sacred bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks made to overcome a target?s spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nProtection: The inquisitor is surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the inquisitor.\r\n\r\nPurity: The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her foes, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, the bonus is doubled against curses, diseases, and poisons.\r\n\r\nResiliency: This judgment makes the inquisitor resistant to harm, granting DR 1/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every five levels she possesses. At 10th level, this DR changes from magic to an alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite the inquisitor?s. If she is neutral, the inquisitor does not receive this increase.\r\n\r\nResistance: The inquisitor is shielded by a flickering aura, gaining 2 points of energy resistance against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the judgment is declared. The protection increases by 2 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nSmiting: This judgment bathes the inquisitor?s weapons in a divine light. The inquisitor?s weapons count as magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. At 6th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The type selected must match one of the inquisitor?s alignments. If the inquisitor is neutral, she does not receive this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but not for reducing hardness).","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":12,"featureName":"Monster Lore (Ex)","featureDescription":"The inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on Knowledge skill checks in addition to her Intelligence modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":15,"featureName":"Cunning Initiative (Ex)","featureDescription":"At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on initiative checks, in addition to her Dexterity modifier.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":7,"featureName":"Spells","featureDescription":"n inquisitor casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an inquisitor?s spell is 10 + the spell level + the inquisitor?s Wisdom modifier.\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Inquisitor. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor?s selection of spells is extremely limited. An inquisitor begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the inquisitor?s choice. At each new inquisitor level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an inquisitor knows is not affected by her Wisdom score. The numbers on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known are fixed.)\r\n\r\nUpon reaching 5th level, and at every third inquisitor level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an inquisitor can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the inquisitor ?loses? the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell?s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast.

An inquisitor can select one domain from among those belonging to her deity. She can select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain. With the GM?s approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.\r\n\r\nEach domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell slots. The inquisitor uses her level as her effective cleric level when determining the power and effect of her domain powers. If the inquisitor has cleric levels, one of her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as an inquisitor.

Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.\r\n\r\nAt 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not resume until she can participate in the combat again.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is evil, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nDestruction: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nHealing: The inquisitor is surrounded by a healing light, gaining fast healing 1. This causes the inquisitor to heal 1 point of damage each round as long as the inquisitor is alive and the judgment lasts. The amount of healing increases by 1 point for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nJustice: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice, granting a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled on all attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.\r\n\r\nPiercing: This judgment gives the inquisitor great focus and makes her spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 sacred bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks made to overcome a target?s spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nProtection: The inquisitor is surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the inquisitor.\r\n\r\nPurity: The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her foes, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, the bonus is doubled against curses, diseases, and poisons.\r\n\r\nResiliency: This judgment makes the inquisitor resistant to harm, granting DR 1/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every five levels she possesses. At 10th level, this DR changes from magic to an alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite the inquisitor?s. If she is neutral, the inquisitor does not receive this increase.\r\n\r\nResistance: The inquisitor is shielded by a flickering aura, gaining 2 points of energy resistance against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the judgment is declared. The protection increases by 2 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nSmiting: This judgment bathes the inquisitor?s weapons in a divine light. The inquisitor?s weapons count as magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. At 6th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The type selected must match one of the inquisitor?s alignments. If the inquisitor is neutral, she does not receive this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but not for reducing hardness).","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":12,"featureName":"Monster Lore (Ex)","featureDescription":"The inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on Knowledge skill checks in addition to her Intelligence modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":15,"featureName":"Cunning Initiative (Ex)","featureDescription":"At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on initiative checks, in addition to her Dexterity modifier.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":7,"featureName":"Spells","featureDescription":"n inquisitor casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an inquisitor?s spell is 10 + the spell level + the inquisitor?s Wisdom modifier.\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Inquisitor. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor?s selection of spells is extremely limited. An inquisitor begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the inquisitor?s choice. At each new inquisitor level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an inquisitor knows is not affected by her Wisdom score. The numbers on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known are fixed.)\r\n\r\nUpon reaching 5th level, and at every third inquisitor level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an inquisitor can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the inquisitor ?loses? the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell?s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast.

An inquisitor can select one domain from among those belonging to her deity. She can select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain. With the GM?s approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.\r\n\r\nEach domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell slots. The inquisitor uses her level as her effective cleric level when determining the power and effect of her domain powers. If the inquisitor has cleric levels, one of her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as an inquisitor.

Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.\r\n\r\nAt 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not resume until she can participate in the combat again.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is evil, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nDestruction: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nHealing: The inquisitor is surrounded by a healing light, gaining fast healing 1. This causes the inquisitor to heal 1 point of damage each round as long as the inquisitor is alive and the judgment lasts. The amount of healing increases by 1 point for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nJustice: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice, granting a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled on all attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.\r\n\r\nPiercing: This judgment gives the inquisitor great focus and makes her spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 sacred bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks made to overcome a target?s spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nProtection: The inquisitor is surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the inquisitor.\r\n\r\nPurity: The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her foes, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, the bonus is doubled against curses, diseases, and poisons.\r\n\r\nResiliency: This judgment makes the inquisitor resistant to harm, granting DR 1/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every five levels she possesses. At 10th level, this DR changes from magic to an alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite the inquisitor?s. If she is neutral, the inquisitor does not receive this increase.\r\n\r\nResistance: The inquisitor is shielded by a flickering aura, gaining 2 points of energy resistance against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the judgment is declared. The protection increases by 2 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nSmiting: This judgment bathes the inquisitor?s weapons in a divine light. The inquisitor?s weapons count as magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. At 6th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The type selected must match one of the inquisitor?s alignments. If the inquisitor is neutral, she does not receive this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but not for reducing hardness).","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":12,"featureName":"Monster Lore (Ex)","featureDescription":"The inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on Knowledge skill checks in addition to her Intelligence modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":15,"featureName":"Cunning Initiative (Ex)","featureDescription":"At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on initiative checks, in addition to her Dexterity modifier.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":7,"featureName":"Spells","featureDescription":"n inquisitor casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list. She can cast any spell she knows at any time without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell?s level.\r\n\r\nTo learn or cast a spell, an inquisitor must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an inquisitor?s spell is 10 + the spell level + the inquisitor?s Wisdom modifier.\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Inquisitor. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor?s selection of spells is extremely limited. An inquisitor begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the inquisitor?s choice. At each new inquisitor level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an inquisitor knows is not affected by her Wisdom score. The numbers on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known are fixed.)\r\n\r\nUpon reaching 5th level, and at every third inquisitor level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an inquisitor can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the inquisitor ?loses? the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell?s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast.

Although not as tied to the tenets of the deity as a cleric, an inquisitor must still hold such guidelines in high regard, despite that fact she can go against them if it serves the greater good of the faith. An inquisitor can select one domain from among those belonging to her deity. She can select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain. With the GM?s approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.\r\n\r\nEach domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell slots. The inquisitor uses her level as her effective cleric level when determining the power and effect of her domain powers. If the inquisitor has cleric levels, one of her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as an inquisitor.

Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.\r\n\r\nAt 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not resume until she can participate in the combat again.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is evil, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nDestruction: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nHealing: The inquisitor is surrounded by a healing light, gaining fast healing 1. This causes the inquisitor to heal 1 point of damage each round as long as the inquisitor is alive and the judgment lasts. The amount of healing increases by 1 point for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nJustice: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice, granting a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled on all attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.\r\n\r\nPiercing: This judgment gives the inquisitor great focus and makes her spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 sacred bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks made to overcome a target?s spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nProtection: The inquisitor is surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the inquisitor.\r\n\r\nPurity: The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her foes, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, the bonus is doubled against curses, diseases, and poisons.\r\n\r\nResiliency: This judgment makes the inquisitor resistant to harm, granting DR 1/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every five levels she possesses. At 10th level, this DR changes from magic to an alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite the inquisitor?s. If she is neutral, the inquisitor does not receive this increase.\r\n\r\nResistance: The inquisitor is shielded by a flickering aura, gaining 2 points of energy resistance against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the judgment is declared. The protection increases by 2 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nSmiting: This judgment bathes the inquisitor?s weapons in a divine light. The inquisitor?s weapons count as magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. At 6th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The type selected must match one of the inquisitor?s alignments. If the inquisitor is neutral, she does not receive this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but not for reducing hardness).","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":12,"featureName":"Monster Lore (Ex)","featureDescription":"The inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on Knowledge skill checks in addition to her Intelligence modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":15,"featureName":"Cunning Initiative (Ex)","featureDescription":"At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on initiative checks, in addition to her Dexterity modifier.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":7,"featureName":"Spells","featureDescription":"n inquisitor casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list. She can cast any spell she knows at any time without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell?s level.\r\n\r\nTo learn or cast a spell, an inquisitor must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an inquisitor?s spell is 10 + the spell level + the inquisitor?s Wisdom modifier.\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Inquisitor. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor?s selection of spells is extremely limited. An inquisitor begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the inquisitor?s choice. At each new inquisitor level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an inquisitor knows is not affected by her Wisdom score. The numbers on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known are fixed.)\r\n\r\nUpon reaching 5th level, and at every third inquisitor level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an inquisitor can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the inquisitor ?loses? the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell?s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast.

Although not as tied to the tenets of the deity as a cleric, an inquisitor must still hold such guidelines in high regard, despite that fact she can go against them if it serves the greater good of the faith. An inquisitor can select one domain from among those belonging to her deity. She can select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain. With the GM?s approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.\r\n\r\nEach domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell slots. The inquisitor uses her level as her effective cleric level when determining the power and effect of her domain powers. If the inquisitor has cleric levels, one of her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as an inquisitor.

Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.\r\n\r\nAt 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not resume until she can participate in the combat again.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is evil, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nDestruction: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nHealing: The inquisitor is surrounded by a healing light, gaining fast healing 1. This causes the inquisitor to heal 1 point of damage each round as long as the inquisitor is alive and the judgment lasts. The amount of healing increases by 1 point for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nJustice: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice, granting a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled on all attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.\r\n\r\nPiercing: This judgment gives the inquisitor great focus and makes her spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 sacred bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks made to overcome a target?s spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nProtection: The inquisitor is surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the inquisitor.\r\n\r\nPurity: The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her foes, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, the bonus is doubled against curses, diseases, and poisons.\r\n\r\nResiliency: This judgment makes the inquisitor resistant to harm, granting DR 1/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every five levels she possesses. At 10th level, this DR changes from magic to an alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite the inquisitor?s. If she is neutral, the inquisitor does not receive this increase.\r\n\r\nResistance: The inquisitor is shielded by a flickering aura, gaining 2 points of energy resistance against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the judgment is declared. The protection increases by 2 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nSmiting: This judgment bathes the inquisitor?s weapons in a divine light. The inquisitor?s weapons count as magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. At 6th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The type selected must match one of the inquisitor?s alignments. If the inquisitor is neutral, she does not receive this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but not for reducing hardness).","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":12,"featureName":"Monster Lore (Ex)","featureDescription":"The inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on Knowledge skill checks in addition to her Intelligence modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":15,"featureName":"Cunning Initiative (Ex)","featureDescription":"At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on initiative checks, in addition to her Dexterity modifier.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":7,"featureName":"Spells","featureDescription":"n inquisitor casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list. She can cast any spell she knows at any time without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell?s level.\r\n\r\nTo learn or cast a spell, an inquisitor must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an inquisitor?s spell is 10 + the spell level + the inquisitor?s Wisdom modifier.\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Inquisitor. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor?s selection of spells is extremely limited. An inquisitor begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the inquisitor?s choice. At each new inquisitor level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an inquisitor knows is not affected by her Wisdom score. The numbers on Table: Inquisitor Spells Known are fixed.)\r\n\r\nUpon reaching 5th level, and at every third inquisitor level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an inquisitor can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the inquisitor ?loses? the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell?s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast.

Although not as tied to the tenets of the deity as a cleric, an inquisitor must still hold such guidelines in high regard, despite that fact she can go against them if it serves the greater good of the faith. An inquisitor can select one domain from among those belonging to her deity. She can select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain. With the GM?s approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.\r\n\r\nEach domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell slots. The inquisitor uses her level as her effective cleric level when determining the power and effect of her domain powers. If the inquisitor has cleric levels, one of her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as an inquisitor.

Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.\r\n\r\nAt 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not resume until she can participate in the combat again.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is evil, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nDestruction: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nHealing: The inquisitor is surrounded by a healing light, gaining fast healing 1. This causes the inquisitor to heal 1 point of damage each round as long as the inquisitor is alive and the judgment lasts. The amount of healing increases by 1 point for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nJustice: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice, granting a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled on all attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.\r\n\r\nPiercing: This judgment gives the inquisitor great focus and makes her spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 sacred bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks made to overcome a target?s spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nProtection: The inquisitor is surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the inquisitor.\r\n\r\nPurity: The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her foes, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, the bonus is doubled against curses, diseases, and poisons.\r\n\r\nResiliency: This judgment makes the inquisitor resistant to harm, granting DR 1/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every five levels she possesses. At 10th level, this DR changes from magic to an alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite the inquisitor?s. If she is neutral, the inquisitor does not receive this increase.\r\n\r\nResistance: The inquisitor is shielded by a flickering aura, gaining 2 points of energy resistance against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the judgment is declared. The protection increases by 2 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nSmiting: This judgment bathes the inquisitor?s weapons in a divine light. The inquisitor?s weapons count as magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. At 6th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The type selected must match one of the inquisitor?s alignments. If the inquisitor is neutral, she does not receive this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but not for reducing hardness).","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":12,"featureName":"Monster Lore (Ex)","featureDescription":"The inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on Knowledge skill checks in addition to her Intelligence modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":15,"featureName":"Cunning Initiative (Ex)","featureDescription":"At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on initiative checks, in addition to her Dexterity modifier.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":7,"featureName":"Spells","featureDescription":"n inquisitor casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list. She can cast any spell she knows at any time without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell?s level.\r\n\r\nTo learn or cast a spell, an inquisitor must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an inquisitor?s spell is 10 + the spell level + the inquisitor?s Wisdom modifier.\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Inquisitor. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).\r\n\r\nAn inquisitor?s selection of spells is extremely limited. An inquisitor begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the inquisitor?s choice.

An inquisitor can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":10,"featureName":"Chains of Justice (Su)","featureDescription":"At 6th level, once per day, you can bind an opponent within 60 feet to you with spectral chains (Will negates). When you take damage from an enemy, the bound target takes this damage as well. Whenever the bound target takes damage from you or one of your allies, you take this damage as well. You and the target are not physically bound to each other, and either can end the connection by breaking the line of effect or exceeding the ability?s range. You may dismiss the chains as a standard action.","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false},{"classId":26,"featureId":11,"featureName":"Judgement (Su)","featureDescription":"Starting at 1st level, an inquisitor can pronounce judgment upon her foes as a swift action. Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.\r\n\r\nAt 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not resume until she can participate in the combat again.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is evil, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nDestruction: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nHealing: The inquisitor is surrounded by a healing light, gaining fast healing 1. This causes the inquisitor to heal 1 point of damage each round as long as the inquisitor is alive and the judgment lasts. The amount of healing increases by 1 point for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nJustice: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice, granting a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled on all attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.\r\n\r\nPiercing: This judgment gives the inquisitor great focus and makes her spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 sacred bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks made to overcome a target?s spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nProtection: The inquisitor is surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the inquisitor.\r\n\r\nPurity: The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her foes, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th level, the bonus is doubled against curses, diseases, and poisons.\r\n\r\nResiliency: This judgment makes the inquisitor resistant to harm, granting DR 1/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every five levels she possesses. At 10th level, this DR changes from magic to an alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite the inquisitor?s. If she is neutral, the inquisitor does not receive this increase.\r\n\r\nResistance: The inquisitor is shielded by a flickering aura, gaining 2 points of energy resistance against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the judgment is declared. The protection increases by 2 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.\r\n\r\nSmiting: This judgment bathes the inquisitor?s weapons in a divine light. The inquisitor?s weapons count as magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. At 6th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The type selected must match one of the inquisitor?s alignments. If the inquisitor is neutral, she does not receive this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor?s weapons also count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but not for reducing hardness).","evalText":null,"evalPriority":0,"activeLevel":0,"enabled":false}]}],"sheetDescription":{"sheetId":120,"gender":"Female","alignment":"LG","deity":"Pharasma","age":"22","height":"5'4\"","weight":"135","visualDescription":"Snooty.","biography":null,"languages":"Common, Elvish"},"sheetGeneral":{"sheetId":120,"hpCurrent":25,"initMisc":4,"fortMisc":0,"refMisc":0,"willMisc":0,"favoredClassId":26,"fcHitPoints":4,"fcSkillRanks":0,"fcAlternateBonus":0,"fcAlternateBonusDesc":"Add one spell known from the inquisitor spell list.
