#### Project Plan


## Pathfinder Character Sheet Organizer
#### Project Statement

My project is going to be used while playing the table-top RPG Pathfinder.  It is aimed at helping myself and others keep track of their character sheets and game-master notes.  At minimum, my website will function similarly to myth-weavers.com and roll20.net.  Myth-weavers is a site that lets you edit your character sheets and save them online.  Roll20 is an online service that acts as a sort of chatroom combined with resources for the GM to use.

I have chosen this project because the current services are either designed for just players, or designed entirely for online use.  When I play Pathfinder, we tend to keep our character sheets on our computers but like using real dice and figures during combat.

#### Things I want to accomplish in order of priority:
  * Editable sheets that are saved in a database
  * Have sheets dynamically update when you edit 
  * Character Creation process page
  * Page where GM can keep notes for their campaign
  * Page where GM can view player sheets
  * Have sheets change from the GM's view
  * Chat-room
  * Commands or buttons in chat-room for rolling dice and changing values
  
======

#### Technologies
  * Log in system with authentication
  * Hibernate to access my database
  * Log4j to help debug
  * JUnit to test
  * AngularJS to make my sheet dynamic like a spreadsheet
  * JQuery for some pages
  * Some sort of way to let users create code that affects sheet fields Ex: SET STRSCORE TO STRSCORE + 2
  * A way to update the GM View when the player updates their sheet
